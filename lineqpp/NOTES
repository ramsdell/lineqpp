			   Developer Notes

This file contains notes for developers.  This file is not part of a
distribution, but simply resides in the CVS repository.

To build a GNU Build System from the sources in the repository, type:

   $ autoreconf -i

To build a distribution, ensure AC_INIT in configure.ac has the right
version number.  Tag the release with a name derived from the version
number.  In other words, if the version number is 2.3, tag the release
with lineqpp-2_3.  Export the release using the given tag.  Then type:

   $ autoreconf -i
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make dist
